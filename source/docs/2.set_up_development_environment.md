## 2.1 Arduino IDE Development Environment Setup

### 2.1.1 Arduino IDE Installation

Ardunino IDE is a powerful software exclusively designed for Arduino microcontrollers. No matter which version it is, the same installation method can be used. This lesson will take the window version of **"Arduino-2.2.1"** as an example to illustrate:

(1) Locate the Arduino IDE installation package in the same folder as this document, as shown in the below figure, and double click to open it. (If you want to download the latest version of the software, you can download it through the Arduino official website [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).)

## 2.2 Arduino IDE Usage Instruction

### 2.2.1 Arduino IDE Interface Setting

(1) Modify the Chinese interface: select **"File"** → **"Preferences"** on the **"Arduino IDE"** interface. Then, choose Chinese from the **"Language"**, and click **"OK"**.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image2.png" class="common_img" />

(2) You can modify the project file path, editor text size, color themes, etc by selecting **"File"** → **"Preferences"** in the pop-up window.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image3.png" class="common_img" />

### 2.2.2 Arduino Download Program

[Source Code]()

(1) In this case, we will use an example that prints **"Hiwonder"** to illustrate. Open the example program **"Demo.ino"** in the [Demo]() folder at the same folder as this document.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image4.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Connect Arduino board to the computer using Type-B cable.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(3) In the **"Select board"** option, find the corresponding Arduino development board. (Take **"Arduino Uno"** and **"COM6"** as en example to demonstrate. The **"COM"** port is not unique. You can can check the **"COM"** port number in the computer’s device manager.)

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(4) Click <img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image7.png" /> button to compile the program, which can check if the program has syntax errors and other issues.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image8.png" class="common_img" />

(5) After the compilation is complete, click <img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image9.png" /> to upload the program into the Arduino development board.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

(6) When the upload is done, click <img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image11.png" /> to open the serial monitor. The word **"hiwonder"** is printed on the serial monitor.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

### 2.2.3 Import Library File (Optional)

If the program requires importing the library files, you can refer to the following operations:

* **Online Importing**

This method is usually used for importing some official Arduino library files, for example, the library file for driving LED dot matrix (TM1640), the library file for OLED screen module (U8g2).

Take the library file for driving LED dot matrix (TM1640) as an example to illustrate:

(1) Click <img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image13.png" /> at the sidebar of Arduino IDE interface.

(2) In the pop-up library management bar, enter **"U8g2"** to automatically search for the library files, then click **"install"**.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image14.png" class="common_img" />

(3) The prompt shown in the red box indicates the successful installation.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image15.png" class="common_img" />

* **Local Importing**

This method is usually used for downloading library file or customizing the library file importing. Here will take the **"U8g2"** library file as an example to illustrate.

(1) Select **"Sketch"** → **"Include Library"** → **"Add .ZIP Library"**.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image16.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Search for the [U2g2.zip]() and open it.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image17.png" class="common_img" />

(3) The prompt shown in the below red box indicates that the library file has been installed already.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image18.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}
In the process of importing the library file in the local, if you encounter the below error during the process of importing library files locally, you can refer to the following solution.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image19.png" class="common_img" />

Take the library file **"LobotServoController"** as example to illustrate. In **"Arduino IDE"** versions 1.8.5 and above, the error above may arise when importing this library file. You can solve this problem by extracting the library file and placing it directly into the **'libraries'** folder in the path of the project. The specific solution is as follows:

(1) At first, extract the library file **"LobotServoController"**.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image20.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Click **"File"**→**"Preferences"** in sequence.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image21.png" class="common_img" />

(3) In the opening preferences, copy the path.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image22.png" class="common_img" />

(4) Paste it in my computer, and then press **"Enter"** to access the path.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image23.png" class="common_img" />

(5) Place the previously extracted library file into the **"libraries"** folder.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image24.png" class="common_img" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_2/media/image25.png" class="common_img" />

(6) Restart **"Arduino IDE"**. The library file has been located in the library of **"Arduino IDE"**.
